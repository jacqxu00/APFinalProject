# Conservation of Energy AsimulaXuon
Jacqueline Xu and Asim Kapparova

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This program is a simulation of the Law of Conservation of Energy through the typical “roller coaster problem,” using a skater in a skate park. This project idea was inspired by <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/energy-skate-park-basics"> PhET Simulations Energy Skate Park </a>. In this simulation, the skater will follow a track at a velocity based on its translational kinetic energy. As with most basic conservation of energy simulations, rotational kinetic energy (kinetic energy from rotating objects) is ignored. </p>

<h2> Physics </h2>
<p> The physics behind the program is pretty simple to understand. The total energy in a system will always remain the same. This total energy is comprised of potential energy (based on object height), kinetic energy (based on object velocity), and thermal energy (based on object angle of motion and total distance traveled). The simulation stores the total energy of the system before the object moves. From then on, it figures out the potential energy (based on object height) and the thermal energy based on the object's angle of motion and distance traveled (found by approximating using the object's previous position and current position). The simulation uses this information to determine the object's kinetic energy, and from that, its velocity. This velocity and the equation of the track is used to determine the object's future position. </p>

<h2> Features </h2>
<p> The user can manually:
	<ul>
	  <li>choose a skate track</li>
	  <li>edit the mass of the skater </li>
	  <li>edit the acceleration by gravity </li>
	  <li>edit the coefficient of friction </li>
	  <li>pause/play the simulation </li>
	  <li>reset the simulation </li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p> The simulation will:
	<ul>
	  <li>determine the skater's velocity based on its energy </li>
	  <li>determine the skater's position </li>
	  <li>display bar graphs of the skater energy levels in real time </li>
	  <li>display the object's properties/variables in real time </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2> Unresolved Bugs </h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>the user can not change any of the text inputs or any of the other settings (options) after the skater has started moving, user must reset then change </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2> How To Compile/Run </h2>
<p> In Terminal, type the following:
	<ol>
	  <li>javac Sim.java </li>
	  <li>java Sim </li>
	</ol>
